          <p class="paragraph-series-info">During this pandemic, my family decided to spend time together in Yosemite Valley. The subjects of almost all the photos I took were either nature or children, because I had noticed a strong sense of resilience within both of them. Although nature is constantly struggling to heal because of harmful human activity, because of COVID-19, people had been ordered to stay at home as much as they could. This meant that nature could finally breathe while continuously showing its resilience and striving to heal. The children in Yosemite were another sign of resilience during this pandemic. Children are always wanting to meet new people or wanting to play outside with their friends. However, the children in Yosemite were only in contact with their parents and nowhere near the other kids. It is unimaginable how difficult it must be for young kids to learn such an immense amount of self-control in a short period of time, but they were able to do it.<br><br>For the world to make it through such devastating times, it takes an incredible amount of resilience.</p>

          <h1 class="photographer-section-name">Hypocrite</h1>
          <p class="paragraph-series-info">My little brother, Christian, started to experience extreme cabin fever during quarantine. He climbed out of the window in the middle of the night multiple times, going by himself to a local playground. Christian is on the autism spectrum and non-verbal. He does not understand the restrictions to reduce the spread of COVID-19. I continued to bring him to the playground, even though it went against health advisories. When beaches and parks opened, my friends invited me to go. I was so anxious with the amount of people on the beach. It was nearly impossible to maintain social distance and most people, including myself, did not wear masks.<br><br>American exceptionalism shows through how people interpret quarantine and social distancing. We continue to ignore the rules set in place to hold onto a sense of normalcy through a pandemic our nation has not controlled  or taken seriously. We make rules for ourselves and think we’re the exception. The United States is not prepared for normal economic activity or regular socialization, but we continue to ignore the risks of COVID-19 to keep some sense of normalcy.</p>

          <p class="paragraph-series-info">Over the last few years, me and my sisters haven’t spent much time together. Whether it be student teaching, getting their first degrees, working in a hospital, navigating odd jobs or getting their second degrees, we have all rarely been in the same place at the same time. This summer was different.<br><br>One by one we arrived at home with uncertainty on our minds and disappointment in our hearts. While it may have been relatively brief, I am grateful for the time spent with my family over these past few months. It strengthened the bond only siblings can have, while also annoyingly (and sometimes jokingly) reminding us of our differences. While it is true that a moment can only last for so long, I have the photographs, like insects preserved in amber, to last for my lifetime and beyond. They are for the Class of 2020. They are for anyone who lost a loved one. They are for anyone who has struggled mentally, physically or emotionally. They are for anyone who needs them, for people stuck in the in-between with me.</p>

          <h1 class="photographer-section-name">Opposites</h1>
          <p class="paragraph-series-info">For the first few weeks of social isolation, I was not inspired. I was content to lay in bed with my laptop, snacking, picking up a book for thirty seconds before my attention quickly dwindled. I was back to consuming as much digital media as my brain could handle.<br><br>I soon began to miss my busy life at school and a large part of what had occupied my time was photographing, editing and thinking about the photos I was going to take next. The photos I was taking were of events or individuals; the story was already there and I was hired to document it. I enjoy this work but as someone who wants to tell stories for a living, I sometimes yearned for a wholly creative outlet where I was in complete control of the art I was creating.<br><br>This led me to fashion portraiture. <br><br>At first, I used myself as the subject because I was in full isolation. I found taking self-portraits to be extremely challenging but also very exciting. Being in front of the camera meant there was always a slight surprise when I came back behind it. When social distancing restrictions eased, I was able to take photos of my friend. We had a wonderful time creating whimsical portraits in a beautiful place that we happened upon. I directed this photoshoot, but my subject had complete control. I now understand why art photographers like Cindy Sherman choose only to create self-portraits.</p>

          <p class="paragraph-series-info">My dad, Randy, knew quarantine was going to last longer than anyone anticipated.When I returned home for what was supposed to be maybe a two week spring breakfrom college, he began setting up a large desk in an already-cramped music roomwith two new monitors as a substitute for his office cubicle. <br><br>My dad is a business systems analyst lead at Northwestern University, and his team initially told him to prepare working from home from March 12th until April27th. He quickly adapted to the quarantine lifestyle in comparison to mymother, sister, and myself. His morning routine shifted from hectic to flexible. He now has more time to walk and feed the dogs, do the dishes, watchthe news without the time crunch of trying to beat traffic before work. His breakfast and lunch still contains maybe a nut or two so at least his hearty diet hasn’t changed. Despite the drastic overall change in daily life, theworkday remains the same — with the added bonus of blasting jazz in his new“workspace” and having a couple dogs curled up at his feet.</p>

A word that describes all the incongruous, fantastical, and unbelievable actions that have stemmed from the COVID-19 pandemic.<br><br>An airport full of people wearing masks. Students participating in virtual or socially distanced graduation celebrations. Empty rows of common store-bought items - inexplicably sold out.  When did toilet paper become so important in Mazlov’s hierarchy of needs? Why does no one have any answers? Is there a divine authority testing us now with the burden we must overcome? And in the midst of this inexplicability, is hope.<br><br>In this crisis, we have been given an opportunity to see through our problems and make a decision to create a better world. This crisis has given us an opportunity to share what we have with others. We have been given a calling to help our communities through engaging in positive health practices such as mask wearing and social distancing. And yet despite all the struggles that COVID-19 has produced life goes on and humanity persists.</p>

I have finished 19 books, eight TV series (with help from a live-texting friend), five knitting projects, and two renovation projects — a bookcase and a record player.

          <p class="paragraph-series-info">In my hometown of West Chester, Pennsylvania, a lively and crowded Gay Street is a daily occurrence. This past March, I watched students of West Chester University pack their bags and hard-working business owners close their stores. I nearly saw the life of the town diminish. But I also watched our community come together in new and unique ways. West Chester has grown stronger through the emptiness.<br><br>My family has always held a strong bond, but prior to the pandemic, it was hard to catch all of us at the same time. With packed schedules and countless commitments, quarantine has allowed us to slow down and breathe. We have grown stronger through the emptiness.<br><br>Each day began to bled into the next, the same cup of coffee paired with the same plot-line to the Rom-Com. From the inside, it felt daunting, from the outside, I could see the inner growth. I have grown stronger through the emptiness.</p>

          <p class="paragraph-series-info">Poet Rudy Franscico wrote “I am made of all the things the world couldn’t take away from me.”<br><br>Because of its absence of noise and a sense of reality, quarantine has been a time of self-reflection for me. I’ve spent a good amount of time drawing in nature. The camera doesn’t seem to be useful during a time like this. The quietness makes me rethink my creation process in a calm and original way. I’ve always looked at artists that inspire me and use them as a motivation to create. But what can you paint on a complete white canvas with limited resources?<br><br>For this project, I combined the calmness that nature brings me and the precious time I’ve got to spend with my friends. I am proud of these works for the fact that I don’t see any other artists’ shadows except for my own. They don’t represent anything else other than what this time means for me and my own reflections.</p>

          <p class="paragraph-series-info">As humans, we adapt. Anger and frustration can turn into happiness. A bad day can lead to a better day. We always try to be optimistic in any situation. When COVID-19 became severe, I was bored and alone, and all my thoughts were just trapped inside my head. I, myself, felt trapped.Everything was worsening: internships canceled, trips gone, friends disconnected. But even when everything seemed so horrible, things eventually became a little better. One by one, I started having tasks. My calendar started to fill up again with work and events and meetings and photo shoots. A pretty bad summer became a not-so-bad summer. Looking back, being trapped inside my head was a time for thinking and healing. Now, even when things are still bad,I cherish every minute of work, of meetings, of shoots because I know that there may be a time when I won’t have any of those things. </p>

          <h1 class="photographer-section-name">Lost</h1>
          <p class="paragraph-series-info">During this pandemic, my family decided to spend time together in Yosemite Valley. The subjects of almost all the photos I took were either nature or children, because I had noticed a strong sense of resilience within both of them. Although nature is constantly struggling to heal because of harmful human activity, because of COVID-19, people had been ordered to stay at home as much as they could. This meant that nature could finally breathe while continuously showing its resilience and striving to heal. The children in Yosemite were another sign of resilience during this pandemic. Children are always wanting to meet new people or wanting to play outside with their friends. However, the children in Yosemite were only in contact with their parents and nowhere near the other kids. It is unimaginable how difficult it must be for young kids to learn such an immense amount of self-control in a short period of time, but they were able to do it.<br><br>For the world to make it through such devastating times, it takes an incredible amount of resilience.</p>
